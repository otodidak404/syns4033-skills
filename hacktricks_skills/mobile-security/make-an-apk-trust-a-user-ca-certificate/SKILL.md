# Make an APK Trust a User CA Certificate



Android applications can restrict which certificate authorities they trust. In an authorized test environment, repackaging an APK with a Network Security Configuration that trusts user-installed CAs can make HTTPS traffic inspection possible. This does not automatically bypass certificate pinning implemented elsewhere in the application.<sup>[[1]](#references)</sup>

## Automatic

[`apk-mitm`](https://github.com/shroudedcode/apk-mitm) automates APK patching for HTTPS inspection and includes patches for several common certificate-pinning implementations.<sup>[[2]](#references)</sup>

## Manual

Decompile the APK:

```bash
apktool d app.apk
```

In `AndroidManifest.xml`, add the following attribute to the `<application>` element if it is not already set:<sup>[[1]](#references)</sup>

`android:networkSecurityConfig="@xml/network_security_config"`

Create or update `res/xml/network_security_config.xml` with the following content. The `system` source keeps the preinstalled trust anchors, while `user` adds user-installed CAs:<sup>[[1]](#references)</sup>

```html
<network-security-config>
    <base-config>
        <trust-anchors>
            <!-- Trust preinstalled CAs -->
            <certificates src="system" />
            <!-- Additionally trust user-added CAs -->
            <certificates src="user" />
        </trust-anchors>
    </base-config>
</network-security-config>
```

Rebuild the APK:

```bash
apktool b app -o patched.apk
```

Repackaging invalidates the original signature, so sign the rebuilt APK before installing it. [See the APK signing section](smali-changes.md#sign-the-new-apk).
