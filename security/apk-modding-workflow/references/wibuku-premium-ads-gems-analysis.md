### Method 3: Manual Decompile & Patch (Advanced)

**Target smali classes to patch:**

1. **Premium checks** (`isPremium` method):
```smali
.method public isPremium()Z
    # BEFORE:
    const/4 v0, 0x0
    return v0
    
    # AFTER (always premium):
    const/4 v0, 0x1
    return v0
.end method
```

2. **Ad loading** (AdMob initialization):
```smali
.method public loadAd()V
    # BEFORE:
    invoke-virtual {p0}, Lcom/google/android/gms/ads/InterstitialAd;->loadAd()V
    
    # AFTER (comment out or return early):
    return-void
.end method
```

3. **Gems/Balance getter**:
```smali
.method public getBalance()I
    # BEFORE:
    # [reads from SharedPreferences]
    
    # AFTER (always return max):
    const v0, 0x3b9aca00    # 999999999
    return v0
.end method
```

**Search patterns:**
```bash
grep -r "isPremium" smali/
grep -r "loadAd" smali/
grep -r "getBalance" smali/
grep -r "InterstitialAd" smali/
```

## Analysis Limitations

This analysis was performed via DEX string scanning only (not full decompilation with JADX). The following could not be verified:

- ❌ Exact package name
- ❌ Specific class/method names for premium checks
- ❌ Server-side validation presence (assumed client-side only)
- ❌ Anti-tamper protection
- ❌ Obfuscation level (ProGuard/R8)

**Recommendation:** For manual patching, decompile with JADX first to identify exact class names:
```bash
jadx -d wibuku_src/ Wibuku.apk
grep -r "isPremium" wibuku_src/
```

---

## Key Findings

1. **All three mod targets confirmed** in DEX strings (premium, ads, gems)
2. **Google Play Billing** used for premium/IAP → Lucky Patcher handles this
3. **AdMob** used for ads → Lucky Patcher can strip this
4. **No server-side validation detected** → Client-side mod should work
5. **Mod difficulty: EASY** (standard billing + ads implementation)

## Alternative: Pre-Modded APK

If Lucky Patcher fails, search these sites:
- `apkmody.io`
- `apkdone.com`
- `moddroid.com`
- `happymod.com`
- `an1.com`

Search term: `"Wibuku mod apk unlimited gems premium no ads"`

**Verify before install:**
- File size ~14-16MB (similar to original)
- User reviews 4+ stars
- Recent upload date
- VirusTotal scan clean
